# The WYW(td)-License

_derived from the WTFPL, including the essence of MIT and of course, some extra fun:
<br>Yes, it can be legally valid and still "fun"_

TLDR: Permissive: Do anything; limit liability; Public Domain for ONLY the changed files, when GIT REVISION of a commit is more recent then the one in this LICENSE
```
The WYW(td)-License v1.1

OK. Let's get started.

#1 b) The purpose of this license is simple.
and you and all other legal entities are expected to just

#  a) DO WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU WANT TO DO

#2 To avoid misunderstanding, now this statement will be defined in some more detail:
#3 I.e. this license grants rights to (but NOT limited exclusively) do the following actions.

- a) Modifications of any kind (e.g. publicly on internet services like GitHub but also privately, on your local machine)
- b) Copying the software (to any location you can possibly think of)
- c) Sale (
	REQUEST/HOPE (NOT required, only preferrably): with real additional content/functionality/modification, other than just changing "a few" bytes or with intent to only meet the bare minimum to "qualify for a useful modification"
        ACTION TAKEN AGAINST PEOPLE WHO DO NOT FOLLOW THE REQUEST/HOPE: None, ever.
)

- d) Using in commercial (incl. patented) software/applications/solutions etc.

#14 STOP READING THE EXAMPLES HERE AND GO AHEAD AND SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH (#7), IF ALL YOU NEED ARE uSeFuL EXAMPLES.
THE BELOW ACTIONS ARE QUITE DETAILED. - ALSO GOOD TO KNOW:
THIS LICENSE LIKELY HAS NO EFFECT ON THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING THESE THINGS ANYWAY.

- e) Deleting from your local or cloud storage
- f) Moving it from one path to another on your local or remote storage device
- g) Uploading it to your own Dropbox
- h) Sending it to a friend via Telegram
- i) Sending it to NASA via Twitter (a link to it)
- j) Sending it to SpaceX via Google+ (oh, wait... you can't do that anymore, for a completely different reason)
- k) Sending it to Government authorities via E-Mail

#7 a) Note: These are merely a few examples of things you can do with this software, this does NOT mean that these are the only things you can do.
#  b) There are virtually no limitations as to what you can do, you just have to assume ALL RESPONSIBILITY for your actions with this software.

#8 To clarify: When mentioned anywhere in this document, "you" and "your" are in reference the the principal software user. - This can be any legal entity.

#9 a) GIT REVISION TAG: abcdefg12345 (example)
#  b) THIS LICENSE APPLIES FOR ANY CONTENT WITHIN ANY GIT REVISIONS OF THE PROJECT, UP UNTIL THE GIT REVISION MENTIONED IN THIS LICENSE (#9a).
#  c) IF THE LATEST COMMIT IS A MERE CHANGE OF THIS DOCUMENT, THE FULL EXTENT OF THIS DOCUMENT ALSO APPLIES TO THAT REVISION, AS SOON AS IT IS UPDATED.

#10 a) FOR ANY OTHER LATER GIT REVISION, BUT ONLY IF 24 HOURS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE LATEST COMMIT AND THIS DOCUMENT IS STILL NOT UPDATED,
       ONLY THE FILES OF THE SOFTWARE THAT HAVE BEEN CHANGED SINCE THE GIT REVISION MENTIONED IN THIS DOCUMENT (#9a) ARE RELEASED TO PUBLIC DOMAIN.
#   b) IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR LEGAL REASONS, ANY AVAILABLE RIGHTS FOR THE FILES CHANGED ARE SET TO THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE BY LAW.
#   c) BOTH OF THESE ADDITIONS ALSO APPLY IF ONLY ONE (1) FILE WAS CHANGED.

#11 IF ANYBODY FOR ANY REASON FINDS THE GIT REVISION MENTIONED HERE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE LATEST PUBLIC CHANGES MADE TO THE SOFTWARE
    AND THEY REQUIRE THIS DOCUMENT TO BE UPDATED, THEY MAY START AN ISSUE ON THE SERVICE IT IS HOSTED ON.

#12 THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH WARRANTY IS DERRIVED FROM ANOTHER PART OF THIS DOCUMENT.
#13 NEITHER AUTHORS NOR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS ASSUME ANY LIABILITY FOR ANYTHING DONE BY USERS OF THIS SOFTWARE,
    WETHER OR NOT THIS SOFTWARE WAS USED TO CREATE THE DAMAGE.```
